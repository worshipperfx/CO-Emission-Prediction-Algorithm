# CO-Emission-Prediction-Algorithm

This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict CO₂ emissions based on vehicle attributes. By analyzing key features such as engine size, fuel consumption, and vehicle class, the model aims to provide accurate emission estimates, contributing to environmental research and automotive innovation.

## Project Overview

The project follows a structured workflow:
- Data collection from a real-world CO₂ emissions dataset
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and relationships
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature selection
- Model building using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance comparison

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Features

- Predicts CO₂ emissions based on vehicle characteristics
- Implements multiple regression models for comparison
- Visualizes feature relationships and model performance
- Provides a reproducible and extendable framework for further research
